# Running the System

Now you already know a lot about Zolinga [event system](:Zolinga Core:Events and Listeners), and you may wonder how to run that beauty. Here is a simple guide to run the system.

- **Page Request**
    > The most natural way to run Zolinga is to type in the URL in your browser. If you wish to know more about GET/POST HTTP requests and how they are processed, you may want to read the [Page Request](:Zolinga Core:Running the System:Page Request) article.
- **AJAX**
    > The second way to run Zolinga is to query Zolinga from your JavaScript code. In a nutshell this is also a GET/POST HTTP request but follows slightly different rules as it expects a JSON response and not fancy HTML page you so meticulously crafted. If you wish to know more about AJAX requests and how they are processed, you may want to read the [AJAX](:Zolinga Core:Running the System:AJAX) article.
- **Command Line**
    > The third way to run Zolinga is to run it from the command line. In fact the logic and processing is very similar to previous methods except that you specify the request in the command line and not in the browser or JavaScript code. You will be surprised that the same event model is used across the board with such a natural feel. If you wish to know more about command line requests and how they are processed, you may want to read the [Command Line](:Zolinga Core:Running the System:Command Line) article.
- **Custom Scripts**
    > This article covers the cases where you need for some reason to run Zolinga through a custom script either over HTTP or command line. It will cover how to easily include Zolinga into your other scripts and use the full power of this amazing framework. For details, please read the [Custom Scripts](:Zolinga Core:Running the System:Custom Scripts) article.
