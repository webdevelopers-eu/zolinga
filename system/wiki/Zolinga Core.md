# Zolinga Core

This is the documentation for the Zolinga Core. Zolinga Core is responsible for the core Zolinga platform functionality and lives in the `./system` directory of your Zolinga installation. For the most part Zolinga Core behaves as the ordinary module and as such follows the same rules as other modules. If you are curious you can sneak peak into `./system/zolinga.json` file to see how it is declared.

To learn more about the framework and how to use it, feel free to browse this branch of the documentation.
